# CANine CAN Adapter

This is a USB Type-C <-> CAN Bus adapter. Itself it is an adaptation of the [CANable board](https://canable.io/). It features a 2.54mm screw terminal, a 4-pin JST-GH connector, and a 2.54mm header. In addition, it features a convenient DIP switch for setting CAN termination resistor and boot mode.

This design is released under the original CANable license.

This directory also includes an STL model for a compact 3D printable case.

There is also an [alternative case design for the legacy CANine](https://github.com/ThotAlion/BLDC-design-help/tree/main/STL/USBCANBox) by ThotAlion.
